I wanted to challenge myself by creating Spotify in React.

[Spotify in React](https://spotify-b596f.web.app).

You can login with your own account and it will display your Spotify information!

I'm using the Spotify API for authentication and grabbing all the users content and displaying (playlists, images, songs etc).

For a quick deploy, I decided to use firebase.

## Future updates coming soon

The next updates I want to finish is adding the functonality to play/stop/next/previous a song.
